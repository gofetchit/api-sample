You will need node.js running on your box.
Install dependencies with ```npm install```

Then you need to register an application with your rogr.io account. Find the developer section and create a sample app as follows:
- Name: What ever you want
- URI: http://localhost:3000/callback

Run the node server with ```node server.js``` but specify the two environment variables CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET first.
The correct values are displayed after creating the app above.
